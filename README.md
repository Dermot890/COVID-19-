# COVID-19
Some charts showing the evolution of the disease globally
The data is downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv which seems to update daily so it should always be current when rerun in colab. 
I save this for my own interest, I don't draw any conclusions or analyse the trends in any way.
